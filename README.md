# Semantic Segmentation: Drone aerial views

This is the fourth project of the Opencv University course ["Deep Learning with PyTorch"](https://opencv.org/university/deep-learning-with-pytorch/).
It focuses on applying semantic segmentation on images taken from drones to differentiate between 12 classes.


## Introduction

Semantic segmentation is a task in computer vision, where the objective is to assign a class label to every pixel in an 
image. This project focuses on classifying the pixels of images taken from drones into 12 classes.


## Data

The project uses a dataset of 3269 images taken by drones with annotated masks for the following 12 classes:
- background
- person
- bike
- car
- drone
- boat
- animal
- obstacle
- construction
- vegetation
- road
- sky


## The method used

Fine-tuning of a DeepLabV3 ResNet-101 pre-trained model using a custom PyTorch training loop. The objective was to learn
how to manually implement all the required steps, particularly the ones of the training loop.

- The dataset was split using a stratified shuffle split scheme into train and validation subsets with 80% and 20% of the 
available data, respectively. The stratification was done based on the presence or not of a class in each image. 

- Various augmentations techniques were used to try to improve generalization.

- The loss function used was an equally weighted combination of the Focal Loss and the Soft Dice Loss:
  - The Focal Loss is a modification of the Cross-Entropy loss focused on learning from hard negative examples.
  - The Soft Dice Loss is effective in addressing the challenge of imbalanced foreground and background regions.

- An SGD optimizer using the setup used by the YOLOv5 training script, where three parameter groups are defined for 
different weight decay configurations.

- A learning rate scheduler that implements the 1-cycle policy. It adjusts the learning rate from an initial rate to a 
maximum, then decreases it to a much lower minimum.

- A custom training loop that includes:
    - updating the optimizer learning rate by using a LR scheduler
    - gradient accumulation
    - evaluation on the validation set
    - tracking of training losses and scores
    - tracking of validation losses and scores
    - tracking of per-class scores


## Discussion

Training this model for 80 epochs resulted in a Dice Score of `0.59310`.

Further improvements to the data splitting process could incorporate the pixel count for each class in every image, 
so that the images are distributed in a way that considers the occurrence of each class, weighted by the size of 
the objects.
